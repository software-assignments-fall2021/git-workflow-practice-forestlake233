I find this article to be very interesting because it talks about the concept of visibility which means the ability to check if a system and its dependencies behave as expected and to identify and speed resolution of any issues that may arise. The article then talks about why OpenTelemetry is the most popular tool for instrumentation, meaning the features that actualizes visibility.

I think visibility is definetely an important factor for developing and maintainng systems efficiently. Seeing that the article highlights how huge financial and human resources are allocated to integrate instrumentations for different technologies due to the lack of a standard protocol of instrumentation, it is encouraging that OpenTelemetry has put in the effort to produce a standard and future proof approch of instrumentation, embedded in the code that developers write. It is more promising that many of the popular services such as AWS is recognizing such an approach and coorporating with OpenTelemetry.
